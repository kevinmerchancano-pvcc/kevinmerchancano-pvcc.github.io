    <h2>Programming Structures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision Structure: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):<br/>While loop: continue looping as long as something is true<br/>Repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is  true<br/>For loop: loop a given number of times</li>
        <li>Recursive structure:<br/>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself<br/>Repetition continues until:<br/>degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met <br/>(degenerativecase is also calles "based case")</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Two classic programming/databse problems</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order<br/>Sorting numbers<br/>Sorting strings (in acordance with ASCII values)</li>
        <li>Searching: Find specific data that meet a certain criteria<br/>In database<br/>Filters: temporary search<br/>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
        <li>Two popular search techniques:<br/>Sequential search: Search from top to bottom or from bottom to top, one item at a time<br/>Binary search<br/>Only works if data is SORTED first<br/>start in the middle then go half of that, etc</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Two classic program goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>Correcteness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
    </ol>
